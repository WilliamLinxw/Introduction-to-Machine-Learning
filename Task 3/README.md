In this project, we are asked to determine, in a triplet consisting of three images, if the first image is more similar to the second one or the third one. The first image is called the anchor, the second is called the positive, and the third is called the negative. To realize the task, a triplet net was implemented, which consists of three parallel convolutional neural networks to extract the features of three input images and map the features onto a 1024 dimensional output using a fully connected layer. The three outputs were fed into the triplet margin loss, where the Euclidean distances between the anchor and the positive and the negative respectively were calculated. The triplet margin loss is to penalize the high distance between the anchor and the positive. Stochastic gradient descent is used to optimize the loss function. The networks' parameters are all updated during training. After training, the network is fed with the test triplets, calculating the distance between the first two and between the first and the third one. If the first distance is higher, outputs 1, otherwise, it outputs 0.

We used Colab to perform training. We need to change the directory to the folder where the data text files and the folder of food images are located. Run the cells until the trained_net = train() can output the prediction, and the prediction file is saved under the stated directory of the train function.
